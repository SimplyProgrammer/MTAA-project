```

2. Install dependencies

   ```

3. Start the app

2. Add to "Path" variable
%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
%ANDROID_HOME%\emulator
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project
WAS ALREADY DONE, DO NOT!

When you're ready, run:

```bash
